## 💡 What Drives Me

I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of AI and making it more accessible. Whether it's morphing faces with StyleGAN or building intelligent chatbots, I love tackling challenging problems that make a real impact.

## 🎯 Current Adventures

- 🧠 Diving deep into the world of face morphing and generative AI at **Bobble AI**
- 🏆 Fresh off winning the **Smart India Hackathon 2024** (Yes, we built an ML model under 7MB!)
- 🔬 Published researcher in face morphing technologies
- 🎓 Pursuing integrated B.Tech + M.Tech in Computer Science at JIIT

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### Git LLAMA 🦙
A smart companion for your GitHub repositories that combines the power of RAG, FAISS, and LLaMA to help you understand codebases better. Think of it as having a senior developer always ready to answer your questions!

### SQLLlama 🗃️
Ever wished you could chat with your database? That's exactly what SQLLlama does! It's like having a friendly DBA who speaks plain English and writes SQL for you.

### EmotiSense 😊
Real-time emotion detection system that helps educators understand student engagement. Because sometimes, facial expressions speak louder than words!

## 🌱 Growing & Learning

Leading the AI/ML Hub at my university has taught me that the best way to learn is to teach others. From organizing workshops to mentoring juniors, I'm always excited to share knowledge and learn from the community.

## 🎮 Fun Facts

- 👨‍💻 I debug with console.log("whatever") more often than I'd like to admit
- 🎵 I code better with lofi beats in the background
- 🧩 Love solving LeetCode problems while sipping chai
- 🌟 Dream project: Building an AI that can understand Indian cultural contexts better
